                Hi 😊 I am Ola, currently in my final year at Sheridan College, pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Software Development and Network Engineering.<br /><br />
                Throughout my academic journey, I have honed a multitude of technical and programming skills.<br /><br />
                Additionally, I have benefited from two co-op work experiences that provided me with practical, hands-on knowledge.<br />
                My first co-op position was in Executive IT Support, while my second was in Data Engineering—a role I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />
                My enthusiasm for data engineering led me to further educate myself in this domain.
                I completed courses such as "Data Engineering Essentials" authorized by IBM through Coursera.<br />
                Alongside, I deepened my understanding of React.js and took the initiative to learn Python.<br /><br />
                I am innately curious and continuously seek opportunities to learn about new technologies and expand my skill set.
            </p>
