                    Hi, I'm Ola. Currently, I'm in my third work term as a Data Engineer at Skill Squirrel. I pursued an Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Technology - Software Development and Network Engineering at Sheridan College for three years. I am expected to graduate by April 2024.
                    <br /><br />
                    Additionally, I have benefited from three co-op work experiences that provided me with practical, hands-on knowledge. My first co-op position was in Executive IT Support, while my second and third ones were in Data Engineering, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am curious and ambitious, eager to learn new concepts and technologies. I completed courses such as "Data Engineering Essentials" authorized by IBM through Coursera (<a href="https://www.credly.com/go/aDvVO9Aj">certificate link</a>). I also deepened my understanding of React.js and took the initiative to learn Python and created my portfolio using React JavaScript.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am innately curious and continuously seeking opportunities to learn about new technologies to expand my skill set.
